I would like to sincerely thank my thesis supervisor Prof. XX for his continuous support during my study and research. His guidance, patience, motivation and long discussions provided a strong platform with clear visibility and research direction.

Besides my advisor, I would like to thank my Student Research Committee members: Prof. AA, Prof. BB and Prof. CC for their insightful comments and encouragement that helped me to widen my research from various perspectives.

I am grateful to the entire team of Networking Lab at IIT Delhi for their motivating discussions on various technical issues related to my research area.

My sincere thanks also goes to Ms. YY for her help in obtaining logistics required for the evaluation setup.
